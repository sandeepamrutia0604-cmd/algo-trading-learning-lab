# Algo Trading Learning Lab

Educational algorithmic trading simulator. Paper-trading only — no real
money, no live orders. See
[algo_trading_learning_lab_project_plan.md](docs/algo_trading_learning_lab_project_plan.md)
for the full phase-by-phase plan.

**Current phase:** Phase 7 - Risk Management: turn on risk-based position sizing, a stop-loss
that auto-exits an auto-trade strategy's position, a cap on open positions, and a cap on how
much capital can sit in one stock — off by default so you can compare "strategy signals alone"
against "strategy signals with risk management" for yourself.

Screens (left navigation):
- **Home** - portfolio hero with equity curve, practice checklist, watchlist, recent trades.
- **Trade** - the terminal: watchlist, candlestick chart with SMA overlays, your BUY/SELL
  markers and strategy signals, order ticket, and a bottom panel for positions, trades,
  market settings and risk management.
- **Strategies** - the lab. Pick a type, tune its parameters, press "Run on history" to mark
  every signal on the chart with its indicators, or turn on auto-trade to place paper trades
  as the market advances. "Try one of each on this stock" creates all six so you can compare.
- **Backtests** - pick a type and starting capital, press "Run backtest" to replay it over
  history: final capital, return, trade count, win rate, max drawdown, an equity curve against
  buy-and-hold, and every simulated trade. Nothing here touches your real paper portfolio.
- **Journal** - a feed of every signal with its reasons and outcome.
- **Compare / Learn** - placeholders for later phases.

Strategy types (all long-only: one position at a time, signals never look ahead):
- **MA Crossover** - fast SMA crosses above/below slow SMA. Best in trends; whipsaws in sideways markets.
- **RSI** - buy when RSI falls below the oversold line, sell above the overbought line.
- **Bollinger Bands** - buy below the lower band, sell above the upper band.
- **Breakout** - buy a new N-day high, exit below the M-day low.
- **Mean Reversion** - buy when the z-score vs the average is very low, sell back at the average.
- **Combined** - a crossover that only buys if RSI, price and volatility checks also pass.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
```

## Run

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 — you should see your ₹1,00,000 virtual
wallet, a candlestick chart, four dummy stocks (ALPHA/BETA/GAMMA/DELTA),
and be able to advance the market day by day (or press Play), change each
stock's price model, buy/sell, and reset the simulation.

Chart: tick the two SMA chips (any period 2-500) to overlay moving averages,
and "My trades" to plot your BUY/SELL markers. Click a stock in the watchlist
to switch the chart and order ticket to it. The market controls (+1 day, +5 days,
Play, speed, Reset) are in the top bar on every screen.

A signal on a given day only uses prices up to that day (no look-ahead). Auto-trade advances the
market one day at a time so each signal trades at its own day's close. To add a strategy type,
create a module in backend/app/strategies/ that defines a StrategyDef and register it in registry.py;
the builder form, API, chart overlays and "Why" cards pick it up automatically.

Risk management (Trade → Risk management tab, off by default): with it on, an auto-trade
strategy's BUY is sized from your risk per trade and stop-loss (`capital × risk% ÷ (price × stop%)`,
same formula as the plan's worked example) instead of its fixed quantity, and a stop-loss
auto-sells its position if the price closes below the entry minus the stop-loss %. Max open
positions and max allocation per stock apply to every BUY, manual or auto-trade. Turn it off
and the app behaves exactly as it did in Phase 4-6 (fixed quantity, no caps, no stop-loss).

Price models: random walk, trending (momentum), volatile (~2.5x swings),
sideways (mean-reverting). Changing a stock's model applies to newly
generated days ("Advance" or "Regenerate history"), not past candles.
